# __Group 5 Project Personal Evaluation__

This is an evaluation of the group project and what have we learned on the personal level.

## Group Members
 * GQ Lewis
 * Pravin Prasad
 * Bryant Allen

## __Accomplishment__

In this project I have accomplished creating a React application with a group of people that I have never worked with. Which is really important for when we transfer into our roles at the full time positions. Another achievement for me is that by spending a lot of time on one project and making it work up until the end solidified my knowledge of javascript to where I could help other people in the class.

## __Challenges__

By doing this project I noticed that I am not as interested in CSS but it is just as important for a project as anything else. Next project I could do better by interacting more with the CSS to be more versatily for upcoming projects.
